#Weather API

###Overview
This program uses the Weather Underground API to provide information about current weather conditions, 10 day forecast (split into day and evening), sun rise/set times, information on current weather alerts, and information on any active hurricanes relative to US waters. This program accomplishes this by taking user input, in this case a zip code, and then utilizing the Weather Underground API to provide relevant data.

###Comments
This project took some acclimation to how API works. I found the most difficult part of this project was figuring out how to write the test. The mini-lecture greatly cleared much of this up.
